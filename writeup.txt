For training, we went through the set and for each classifying cuisine we calculated the probability that it would contain each type of ingredient. This was done by summing all the instances of each type of ingredient. After that we manipulate the probabilities slightly to account for the instances in which an ingredient never exists in a training recipe (we do not want the probability of an ingredient being in a recipe of a certain type to be zero just because it was not encountered in our training set). 

When we went through the testing set, for each recipe we calculate the probability that it would be classified as each type of cuisine. To do that, we go through each ingredient that it does and does not contain and sum up the log of the likelihood that each ingredient's presence or absence would be the value that it is based off of the current cuisine type we are checking. The reason that we take the sum of the logs of each ingredient's probability instead of multiplying them all is because the repeated multiplication would very likely cause a such a low value that the program would truncate it to zero.
